ClinicalTrial,35,how can I find out about clinical trials for treatment?,"For clinical trials around the world, you can visit the World Health Organization Interntional Clinical Trials Registry Platform."
ClothMask,36,Does wearing a cloth mask help?,Yes. CDC recommends wearing cloth masks in public settings where social distance can be difficult to maintain such as grocery stores and pharmacies. Wearing cloth masks helps slow the spread of virus and help people who may be infected and do not know to not transmit it to others. Cloth face coverings are easier to make at a low cost. It's not recommended for children under 2 as well as ones with difficulty breathing.
ConcernFood,37,Are we going to run out of food?,"That's a valid concern. Fortunately, there are no nationwide shortages of food, although in some cases the inventory of certain foods at your grocery store might be temporarily low before stores can restock.Food production and manufacturing are widely dispersed throughout the U.S. and there are currently no wide-spread disruptions reported in the supply chain."

DIYMasks,42,can I make DIY masks to protect myself?,"CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies), especially in areas of significant community-based transmission.CDC also advises the use of simple cloth face coverings to slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others. Cloth face coverings fashioned from household items or made at home from common materials at low cost can be used as an additional, voluntary public health measure.Cloth face coverings should not be placed on young children under age 2, anyone who has trouble breathing, or is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.The cloth face coverings recommended are not surgical masks or N-95 respirators. Those are critical supplies that must continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance."

HowContagiousCOVID,69,How contagious is COVID-19?,"It depends on whether you are asking ""How likely am I to get COVID-19 from someone else?"" or ""How likely am I to give COVID-19 to someone else?"". The first question is difficult to answer because that depends on a variety of factors like how old you are, how healthy you are, whether you are immuno-compromised, and how closely you interact with people who are potentially infected.

If you think you may have COVID-19, you can reduce these chances by following strict self-quarantine practices until your symptoms resolve."

ImmunityAfterCOVID,74,"After having COVID19, do you have immunity to it?","Honestly, we're not entirely sure. Providers on the frontlines are currently working hard to identify those who are infected, and we will learn more about long-term immune protection from second or third infections in the coming months. However, coronaviruses are not new to humans, and existing data suggests that humans develop protective immunity once infected with these other coronaviruses. So we expect that once infected, an otherwise healthy person should not experience a second infection with the same strain, but this guidance will of course be updated as we learn more. To complicate matters, there have been recent cases where COVID-19 survivors test positive for the virus. We are all still learning!"

PrecautionFoodBusiness,107,"What special precautions should restaurant owners, kitchen managers, or other folks with food-related businesses be taking?","Food facilities, like other work establishments, need to follow protocols set by local and state health departments, which may vary depending on the amount of community spread of COVID-19 in a particular area. The U.S. Department of Agricluture encourages coordination with local health officials for all businesses so that timely and accurate information can guide appropriate responses in each location where their operations reside. To prevent spread of COVID-19, CDC is recommending individuals employ social distancing or maintaining approximately 6 feet from others, when possible. In food production/processing facilities and retail food establishments, an evaluation should be made to identify and implement operational changes that increase employee separation. However, social distancing to the full 6 feet will not be possible in some food facilities. Maintaining social distancing in the absence of effective hygiene practices may not prevent the spread of this virus. Food facilities should be vigilant in their hygiene practices, including frequent and proper hand-washing and routine cleaning of all surfaces."

Q241,164,How does the virus affect pregnant women?,It is hard to say.It depends on the actions taken by community to stop the spread of the virus.
Q247,165,When we anticipate a slow down in covid-19 spreading?,"Neither the CDC nor the WHO have addressed whether susceptibility is impacted by blood type.Studies of small populations of infected individuals have not undergone peer review and do not yield consistent outcomes.We do know that it is important to follow social distancing and hygiene recommendations in order to prevent infection.For more information, check the CDC website"

mandarin,259,Is it true that a madarin orange in Malaysia spead the COVID-19 there?,"Currently, the CDC is not recommending use of N95 masks by the general public primarily because respiratory virus transmission largely occurs through close contact (less than 6 ft) between people. N95 masks are currently in very short supply and are desperately needed by healthcare workers treating infected patients.

If you are sick, you should wear a facemask when you are around other people (e.g., sharing a room or vehicle) and before you enter a healthcare provider's office. If you are not able to wear a facemask (for example, because it causes trouble breathing), then you should do your best to cover your coughs and sneezes, and people who are caring for you should wear a facemask if they enter your room. If you are not sick, you do not need to wear a facemask unless you are caring for someone who is sick (and they are not able to wear a facemask). Facemasks may be in short supply and they should be saved for caregivers.
